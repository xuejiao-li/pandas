    "* How to define a string with single, double, and triple quotes\n",
    "* How to recognize the backslash escape character\n",

    "In the previous notebook we briefly looked at the basic numeric types, **`int`** and **`float`**. These types are quite simple and straightforward. They behave how you would expect them. We now turn to **strings** which are a more complex type. Python uses the keyword **`str`** to represent strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Built-in Types\n",
    "Before diving into strings, let's take a moment to discuss **built-in types**. The word **built-in** refers to features of the language that come standard with each installation of Python. They form the core part of the language from which all other features and libraries are built from. The most common and prevalent built-in types are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `bool`\n",
    "* `int`\n",
    "* `float`\n",
    "* `str`\n",
    "* `tuple`\n",
    "* `list`\n",
    "* `set`\n",
    "* `dict`\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several more built-in types such as **`complex`**, **`frozenset`**, **`bytes`**, and others but these are used far less frequently than the list above. To see all the built-in types see this (very long) [page from the official Python documentation][1]\n",
    "\n",
    "## The term data type\n",
    "You will often see the term **data type** used when discussing **types**. They refer to the same concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Back to strings - what are they?\n",
    "Technically, a Python string is a sequence of characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "## So what are characters?\n",
    "A character is the smallest possible component of text, usually a letter of an alphabet or punctuation that you can output with one key from your keyboard. There is no separate types for characters. A single character is just a string with length of one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Internally, each character in Python is represented as an integer. For instance, the integer 65 corresponds to **`A`** and 947 corresponds to **`Î³`**, the Greek letter Gamma. This system of encoding is called **Unicode**. Unicode has become a industry standard for character representation. See the [documentation][2] for more on characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### More on Unicode\n",
    "Before Unicode, one of the first computing standards for character representation was ASCII, a system that represented 128 unique characters using 7 bits. A bit is the smallest unit of information for a computer and is binary (0/1). So 7 bits can encode 2^7 (128) different pieces of information and for ASCII, this information corresponded to characters, numbers, and punctuation common to English language speakers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since there happen to be many thousands of languages and tens of thousands of different character representations, Unicode was brought into existence to universally cover any possible writing system. Unicode represents each character with 4 **bytes**, and with 8-bits per byte that is 32 bits which can represent 2^32 or over 4 billion unique characters. Each number in Unicode is called a **code point** and represents a single unique character.\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Creating our first string\n",
    "Strings are created by writing a sequence of characters surrounded by either single or double quotes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reminder to execute all code cells\n",
    "Remember to execute (**shift/ctrl + enter**) each code cell below while reading through the notebook.\n",
