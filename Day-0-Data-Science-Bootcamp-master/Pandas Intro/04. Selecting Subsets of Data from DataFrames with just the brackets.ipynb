    "# Pandas dual references: by label and by integer location\n",

    "\n",
    "But, what hasn't been mentioned, is that each row and column may be referenced by an integer as well. I call this **integer location**. The integer location begins at 0 and ends at n-1 for each row and column. Take a look above at our sample DataFrame one more time.\n",

    "The rows with labels **`Aaron`** and **`Dean`** can also be referenced by their respective integer locations 2 and 4. Similarly, the columns **`color`**, **`age`**, and **`height`** can be referenced by their integer locations 1, 3, and 4.\n",
